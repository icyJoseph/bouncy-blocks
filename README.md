# Bouncy Blocks

A playground experiment, using Rust wasm-bindgen, to interface with a canvas element and draw a few blocks.

Additionally, the Web Audio API is used to capture noise, and based on thresholds, lift the blocks against gravity.

## TODO:

- [x] Add more blocks on click
- [ ] Move more logic into WASM
- [ ] Perhaps use smaller blocks, and enable collisions between them
- [ ] Gravity is a field, function of frequency
